    "1. Linear:\n",
    "- Means progressing from one stage to another in a single series of steps (sequential) extending along a straight or nearly straight line.\n",
    "2. Regression: \n",
    "- The statistical terminology for regression is to determine the relationship between one dependent variable (can be many) and series of independent variable(only one which we are trying to predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose -\n",
    "- to predict or forecast value based on input.\n",
    "- input is termed as independant variable and output as dependent variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "The linear regression line has an equation: \n",
    "- y = Beeta0 + Beeta1*x\n",
    "- y = mx + c\n",
    "- where Y is dependent variable, X is independent variable, Beeta1 or m is slope and Beeta0 or c is intercept (the value of y when x = 0).\n",

    "There are 2 types of Linear Regression models: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple Linear Regression - \n",
    "- Is is a linear regression model with one independent variable and one dependent variable y = B0 +B1*x1\n",
    "\n",

    "- It is linear regression model with more than one independent variable and one dependent variable, y = B0 + B1*x1 + B2*x2 .....\n",

    "#### How to decide which line is best?\n",

    "1. Linearity - linear relationship between Y and each x\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity - residuals have constant variance across all  predicted values.\n",
    "3. Multivariate Normality - Residuals should be normally distributed around the regression line.\n",
    "4. Independence - of the observations, includes \"no autocorrction\"\n",
    "5. Lack of Multicollinearity - Predictiors are not correlated with each other.\n",
    "6. The Outlier Check - Extreme values that may disproportionately influence the regression results.\n",

    "### Adjusted R-squared deals with this issue.\n",
